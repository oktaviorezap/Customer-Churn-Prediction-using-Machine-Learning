# DQLab - Python Project : Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning
# Project Brackground
**Business Problem:**
<br>DQLab Telco is a telecommunications company that already has many branches spread everywhere. Since its establishment in 2019, DQLab Telco has consistently paid attention to its customer experience so that customers will not be left behind.
<br>Although only a little over 1 year old, DQLab Telco already has many customers who have switched subscriptions to competitors. The management wants to reduce the number of customers who switch (churn) by using machine learning.
<br>
<br>
<br> **Solution Problem:**
<br>As a data scientist, I am asked to create the right model. In this assignment, I will do Machine Learning Modeling using June 2020 data.
<br>
<br>The steps that will be taken are:
1.    Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2.    Perform Data Pre-Processing
3.    Performing Machine Learning Modeling
4.    Determining the Best Model
